Install MSYS2: http://www.msys2.org/.

Follow setup instructions on the MSYS2 homepage.

Launch mingw64 shell from the MSYS2 folder.

Install packages:
    `pacman -S base-devel git mercurial cvs wget p7zip`
    `pacman -S perl ruby python2 mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain`
    `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5-static`

Build by running:
    `full/path/to/qt5-static/bin/qmake.exe mediawriter.pro "CONFIG+=release"`
    `mingw32-make`
    (use "mingw32-make -j(number of cores)" to speed up the build)

The result are mediawriter.exe and helper.exe which need to be distributed and run together.
